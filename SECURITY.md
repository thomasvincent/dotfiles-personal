### Security Policy for Personal Dotfiles Repository

#### Supported Configurations

This section outlines which configurations in the dotfiles repository are actively maintained and updated. As dotfiles do not typically use semantic versioning, this will list configurations by their environment or tool names.

| Configuration | Supported              |
| ------------- | ---------------------- |
| macOS Settings | :white_check_mark:    |
| Linux Settings | :white_check_mark:    |
| Windows Settings | :x:                  |
| Generic Settings | :white_check_mark:   |

#### Reporting a Vulnerability

Since dotfiles often contain personal settings and can be accidentally exposed to security risks, it's important to manage vulnerabilities responsibly. If you find a security issue within these dotfiles, particularly one that could impact others if these files are publicly accessible, please report it.

- **Where to Report**: Send your vulnerability report directly to me via email at [thomasvincent@gmail.com](mailto:thomasvincent@gmail.com). Please do not report security issues through public channels such as GitHub Issues since they may contain sensitive information.

- **What to Include**: Describe the issue in as much detail as possible, including:
  - The specific configuration or script affected.
  - Steps to reproduce the issue or why it might be a concern.
  - Any suggestions for mitigating the issue, if known.

- **Response Expectations**: I aim to acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours. Iâ€™ll evaluate the issue and may contact you for further discussion. If a fix is developed, I will notify you when it is implemented.

- **Handling of the Vulnerability**: Depending on the severity and feasibility, I will either patch the vulnerability directly or provide guidelines on how to avoid the risk until a fix can be applied. Public disclosure of vulnerabilities will be handled sensitively to avoid undue risk to others.

#### Updates and Changes

This security policy may be updated periodically to reflect new security practices and the changing nature of personal computing environments.
